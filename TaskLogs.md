 ## For meeting on 13th April
 To do:
 -> Implement norm and HSV comparisons
 -> Check errors in the images list "image_files" to ensure the images are being compared in order
 Solutions:
 -> List "image_files" was sorting based on string names. Changed it to numerical value order so now the comparisons are fine. 
 -> Graphs showing reasonable results for orb and SSIM.
    Histogram - unsure
 -> norm results are bad
 -> not yet implemented HSV
